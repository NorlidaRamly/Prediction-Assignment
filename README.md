Assignment Module 8 - Practical Machine Learning: Prediction Assignment Writeup

Introduction
In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.
The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which the participants did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. The machine learning algorithm will be apply to the 20 test cases available in the test data.

Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, my goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
